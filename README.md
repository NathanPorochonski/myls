# myls
This program is essentially a simpler version of the Linux "ls" command.

To run, type "./myls" in a terminal of the directory where the executable is located followed by the path of the directory where the entries are to be listed.

The "-f" flag can also be added after the directory path to list the entries in ascending alphabetical order. Similarily, the "-b" flag is used for descending alphabetical order.
